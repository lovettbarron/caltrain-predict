# Caltrain + Smokey the Bear
This project is an attempt to analyze twitter (and other) datas to understand whether I can detect disruption within the Caltrain system, and map (with some degree of accuracy) the probability that something will go wrong.

For those who don't know, the Caltrain is the primary more of transit for a lot of us in IDEO Palo Alto. Since most of us live in San Francisco, we spend about 40-60min each way traveling between PA and SF. Unfortunately, every once in a while (it feels like every week), something happens to the Caltrain. There are semi-frequent suicides, car or bike collisions, accidents on platforms, or mechanical failures. As you can imagine, the emotional impact of these events can add up.

I'm curious about whether or not I might be able to clip the edge off that emotional impact with a tool for my colleagues. We can't stop the individual events that befall the caltrain, but maybe if it was expected: maybe if we prepared ourselves mentally and emotionally to spend an extra hour trapped in the car or hanging out in our baller studio space, maybe it wouldn't be quite so bad.

Additionally, I'm curious about what trends exist in these accidents. Are they always around the peak commuting hours? Are they more likely to occur for North or Southbound trains? Are there specific trains that have a higher mortality or failure rate, either by lieu of their timing or their status as a bullet?

Finally, this is basically a way for me to step away from the many, many data analysis and programming tutorials I've been going through, or classes I've been taking, and take a first stab at my own project in this domain. It also corresponds with the first day of my several month long Data Science program at General Assembly, so the timing isn't too bad too and should give me some ideas for future work.

I'm using ipython notebooks for almost all of it, with the intent of sharing process, thinking, and reproducable methods. Please check the license file for details on reuse. :)
